<h1> Working with Python Libraries: PyPika</h1>

* This repository contains examples and code snippets for working with PyPika, a Python library for building SQL queries dynamically using a fluent interface.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

* PyPika simplifies the process of generating complex SQL queries by providing an intuitive API for constructing SQL queries in Python code. With PyPika, you can easily build SQL queries dynamically, making it ideal for applications that require dynamic query generation based on user input or other runtime conditions.

<h2>Installation</h2>
You can install PyPika using pip:

```bash
pip install pypika
```
Import PyPika into your Python script:
```python
from pypika import Query, Table
```
Create a table object representing the database table you want to query:

```python
users = Table("users")
```
Use PyPika's fluent interface to build SQL queries:

```python
query = Query.from_(users).select(users.name, users.email).where(users.age > 18)
```
Get the generated SQL query string:

```python
sql_query = query.get_sql()
```
Execute the query using your preferred database driver.
