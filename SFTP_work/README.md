<h1>Working with Python Libraries: SFTP</h1>

* This repository contains examples and code snippets for working with SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) using Python.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

* SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol that provides a secure method for transferring files over a network. Python offers several libraries for interacting with SFTP servers, allowing you to perform various file transfer operations programmatically.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You may require paramiko, a Python library for SSH protocol implementation:

```
pip install paramiko
```

Import the required modules for SFTP operations:
```
import paramiko
```

Establish an SFTP connection to the remote server:
```python
# Initialize SSH client
ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

# Connect to the SSH server
ssh_client.connect(hostname='your_host', port=22, username='your_username', password='your_password')

# Create an SFTP session
sftp = ssh_client.open_sftp()
Perform SFTP operations such as uploading, downloading, or listing files:
python
Copy code
# Upload a local file to the remote server
sftp.put(local_path, remote_path)

# Download a file from the remote server to the local machine
sftp.get(remote_path, local_path)

# List files and directories on the remote server
files = sftp.listdir()

```
Close the SFTP session and SSH connection when finished:
``` python
# Close the SFTP session
sftp.close()

# Close the SSH connection
ssh_client.close()
```
<h2> Examples</h2>
